<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This repository contains the code that will be used for the 2023 GLEON
virtual meeting
(<https://gleon.org/meetings/GLEON2023Virtual/Program_Overview>) and
2022 GLEON all hands meeting workshop: Working with data from the US
National Ecological Observatory Network
(<https://gleon.org/meetings/gleon22/Workshops>).

<!-- ****** Organizers ****** -->

Organized by Kevin Rose (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) and led by
Kaelin Cawley, Bobby Hensley, and Stephanie Parker (all from NEON).

<!-- ****** Prep ****** -->

## Preparation for the workshop

1.  Optional, but very helpful! Create an API token using the
    instructions in the following tutorial, which shouldn’t take more
    than 10 minutes
    (<https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial>)
2.  Ensure that you have a recent R version installed on your computer.
    (Tutorial leaders will have version \>= 4.2.0)
3.  The tutorial leaders will use RStudio, which is also recommended,
    but optional.
4.  Install required packages: `neonUtilities`, `tidyverse`, `ecocomDP`,
    `vegan`, `ggplot2`, and `lubridate.`. You can run the following to
    install all the packages:
    install.packages(c(‘neonUtilities’,‘tidyverse’,‘ecocomDP’,‘vegan’,‘ggplot2’,‘lubridate’))
