<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This repository contains the code that will be used for the 2022 GLEON all hands meeting workshop: Working with data from the US National Ecological Observatory Network (https://gleon.org/meetings/gleon22/Workshops).

#Add in information here about the code and links that will be used

<!-- ****** Organizers ****** -->

Organized by Kevin Rose (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) and led by Kaelin Cawley, Bobby Hensley, and Steph Parker (all from NEON).

<!-- ****** Prep ****** -->
## Preparation for the workshop
1. Optional, but very helpful! Create an API token using the instructions in the following tutorial, which shouldn't take more than 10 minutes (https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial)
2. Ensure that you have a recent R version installed on your computer. (Tutorial leaders will have version >= 4.2.0)
3. The tutorial leaders will use RStudio, which is also recommended, but optional.
4. Install required packages: `neonUtilities`, `tidyverse`, `ecocomDP`, `vegan`, `ggplot2`, and `lubridate.`. 

#Add code lines here for how to install packages.
